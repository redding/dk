# Dk

"Why'd you name this repo dk?" "Don't know"

This is some automated task runner thingy ala cap/rake (except without all the drama, breaking changes and difficult-to-test-ness).  You define tasks using classes; these tasks do stuff (maybe run some local or remote system commands?); you write tests for these tasks; you run them with a CLI.

## Usage

TODO: Write code samples and usage instructions here

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'dk'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dk
